            <td>The 2023 ITRC report found 78% of identity compromise cases came from scams. The most common form was account takeover (52%), followed by new-account creation fraud (36%). Scammers are becoming more sophisticated, using fake job postings and phishing to trick victims. Identity theft continues to evolve as criminals exploit personal vulnerabilities and system weaknesses.</td>

            <td>The 2024 study reports Americans lost $43B to identity fraud in 2023. Traditional identity theft caused $23B, while account takeover ($13B) and new-account fraud ($5.3B) also increased. Criminals increasingly rely on stolen data to open new accounts or access existing ones. These trends emphasize the financial impact of identity theft and the importance of strong digital hygiene and early detection.</td>
